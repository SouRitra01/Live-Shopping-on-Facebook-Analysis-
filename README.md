# Project Title: Live Shopping on Facebook Analysis using K-means Clustering Algorithm

# Project Overview:
I recently completed a project that analyzed live shopping events on Facebook using the K-means Clustering Algorithm. The project involved collecting data on live shopping events on Facebook, and then using the K-means Clustering Algorithm to group similar events together and analyze the results.

# Objective:
The objective I set for myself was to use the K-means Clustering Algorithm to analyze live shopping events on Facebook and identify patterns and trends in these events. I used the algorithm to group similar events together and analyzed the results to gain insights into live shopping on Facebook.

# Methodology:
Here's how I approached this project:

- Data Collection: I collected data on live shopping events on Facebook, including information on the products being sold, the audience, and other relevant factors.
- Data Preprocessing: I preprocessed the collected data to prepare it for modeling.
- K-means Clustering: I used the K-means Clustering Algorithm to group similar events together and analyze the results.
- Results Analysis: I analyzed the results of the K-means Clustering Algorithm to identify patterns and trends in live shopping events on Facebook.

## Expected Results:
The expected results I achieved were insights into live shopping events on Facebook, including patterns and trends in the products being sold, the audience, and other relevant factors. I used the K-means Clustering Algorithm to group similar events together and analyzed the results to gain these insights.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, I successfully completed a project that analyzed live shopping events on Facebook using the K-means Clustering Algorithm. The results of this project can be useful for businesses and marketers who are interested in understanding the trends and patterns in live shopping events on Facebook.
